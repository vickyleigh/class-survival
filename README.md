# class-survival
Shiny app made for medic class reunion https://vickyleigh.shinyapps.io/ClassSurvival/

Data from ONS (2017) deaths and populationns. This data only had information for up to 2016, so after this the cumulative probabilty 
for survival was found by forecasting the data.

An Rmarkdown file was made to accompany the Shiny app. This was used to test my calculations before I made the app and is slightly nicer to read in case I need to run a similar analysis again.
